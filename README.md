### Where can I see your demo?
You can find my demo in Github.com by following the github link that I wrote above.

### What was your experience?
I had a great deal of difficulty in debugging my code which taught me that it is good to have a nice variable name.

### What have you learned/improved?
I learned more how to display data randomly and components as well which was really new for me. I also understand more how custom hook works which makes me feel strong and happy a bit more. I still need to improve my knowledge on how react really works because I struggled a lot to solve this project. I also couldn't finish all so I need to finish so that it will works properly.

I think it is really important to have clean and well named code.
